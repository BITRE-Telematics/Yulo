====== Processing ======
Created Friday 01 February 2019

These scripts and processes form the basic processing.

For a given vehicle it must go through

[[./Tripgrouping.txt|TripGrouping]] - Where trips and stops will be defined and JSON produced for mapmatching

[[./Barefoot.txt|Barefoot]] - matching observations to roads and intuiting further data

[[./postbarefoot.txt|Postbarefoot]] - merging matched data and geocoding overvations and stops for uploading

[[../Storage_of_processed_data/neo4j/uploadscripts|Graphuploading]] - Adding observations and stops to the database


In addition the following scripts must be run periodically

[[+stopclustering]] - defining stops that are clustered spatially and temporally that identify important locations and those that are anonymous

[[../Storage_of_processed_data/neo4j/uploadscripts|addvehicledata]] and addsegments - incorporating data on vehicles and segments into the database
