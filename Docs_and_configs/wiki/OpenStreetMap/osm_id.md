# osm id
Created Tuesday 01 May 2018

And OSM_ID in the informal term given to unique ids for OSM objects within an OSM class. That is, an id (osm_id) of "43234255" would be assigned to only one object within each class of ways, places, nodes, natural objects etc, but may be assigned to multiple objects accross those classes. Since we only use ways in this project the distinction is not entirely important. The ABSOLUTE unique identifier is the place_id.

As far as I can tell the osm_id, although consisting entirely of digits, is always stored as a string
