# Inference
Created Friday 08 May 2020

This is speculative (2020-05-08). I have been considering the use of Bayesian inference to derive estimates of variance for segments and cross tabs of segments (especially by hour) where data is sparse. This is because reasonable priors can be obtained from cross tabs of the same segment, segments in its region or class.

Something to investigate. If a multilevel model was used to derive posterior distributions for segment speeds by cross tab, should the time of day be treated as a continuous variable (requiring a higher order polynomial model if we assume ~ 2 peak hour periods), and ordered index, or a pooled non ordered ndex.
