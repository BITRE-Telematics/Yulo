This wiki is initially built out of my original process documentation, but should adapt to the new style as I add information. It is very irregularly updated and is usually not current.
It covers the [FPMP](./FPMP.md) project as a whole, as well as the specific systems of processing I have tentatively called [Yulo](./Yulo.md)
There are two broad systems. Most pages here describe the older system implemented largely in python scripts called by [process.sh](./process.sh.md). The second, favoured approach, is [Processing:Yuloserver](./Processing/Yuloserver.md) written in golang. These are equivalent in almost all aspects, although the latter is faster and more reliable.
