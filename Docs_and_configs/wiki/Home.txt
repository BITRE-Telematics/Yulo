This wiki is initially built out of my original process documentation, but should adapt to the new style as I add information
It covers the [[FPMP]] project as a whole, as well as the specific systems of processing I have tentatively called [[Yulo]]
There are two broad systems. Most pages here describe the older system implemented largely in python scripts called by [[process.sh]]. The second, favoured approach, is [[Processing:Yuloserver]] written in golang. These are equivalent in almost all aspects, although the latter is faster and more reliable.
