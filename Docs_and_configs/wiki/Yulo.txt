====== Yulo ======
Created Friday 27 April 2018

I am tentatively naming the processing framework (as an adaptable component built for the larger [[FPMP|Freight Performance and Measurement Project]]) "Yulo". Yulo is the [[http://hri.newcastle.edu.au/AwabakalEnglish/Awabakal1834.html|Awabakal word for foot.]] This reflects both the debt owed to the [[Processing:Barefoot|Barefoot]] repository and the [[http://hri.newcastle.edu.au/AwabakalEnglish/Awabakal1834.html|pre-European elements]] of the Australian road network including Watt St in Newcastle in Awabakal country.

Yulo as a framework consists of the following elements

Homogenisation of raw data including [[Raw data and perparation:Data read in|read in]] and adjustments of [[Raw data and perparation:Timezones|timezones]].
[[Processing:Tripgrouping|Grouping GPS observations into trips and stops]] using a clustering mechanism.
Identifying [[Processing:SummaryStops|anonymous stop clusters]].
Matching GPS coordinates to the road network and imputing the use of other roads using a modified version of [[Processing:Barefoot|Barefoot]].
[[Processing:postbarefoot|Extracing data from barefoot JSON]] and imputing other data
A database structure for [[Storage of processed data|storing processed data]] and [[Display and queries:Queries|querying it]]
