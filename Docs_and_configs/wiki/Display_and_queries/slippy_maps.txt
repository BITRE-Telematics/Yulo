====== slippy maps ======
Created Friday 18 May 2018

Slippy maps are maps, like OSM and Google based on tiles than can be endlessly scrolled. These include
Pre rendered tiles
Vector tiles
Canvas tiles

Any actual front end for the data will likely have to use these options to create specialised tiles, since the current app, using the whole vector data, is prohibitively slow.

As of December 2018 I am using vector tiles generated by [[leaflet app:mapbox]]. This will be relatively expensive as an implemented solution, but not prohibitively so.
