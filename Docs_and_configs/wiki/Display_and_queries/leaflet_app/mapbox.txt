====== mapbox ======
Created Monday 22 July 2019

I am using the mapbox tile server to create tiles for the shinyapp. 

The tiles are rendered in a user defined style using a combination of data uploaded and mapbox data which is largely [[OpenStreetMap]] derived. This data can also be out of date and thus the shapefile may display differently to the way displayed on the base road style in the tiles. As of 2019-07-22 for instance, the route in the mapbox data for the Stradbroke Island Ferry differs from the current OSM data.

The data can be uploaded manually as a zipped shapefile, geojson or other format through the website (once an account has been created). Graphupload/add_tiles.py is a script to zip a shapefile and upload it. It requires a shapefile to be created, perhaps with the unfinished Shinyleaflet/make_shapefile.R script, but generally from the spatial object used by Shinyleaflet. It also requires a secret token with upload privileges.

I am working on a way to script the style so it does not require manual creation in mapbox studio. In addition this can update the trips style which is sensitive to the range within the data, unlike speed ranges which should remain stable.
