====== Map connectivity error ======
Created Friday 27 April 2018

Barefoot was also producing errors around Doomben racecourse in Brisbane. Eventually I worked out it was a map error that was preventing vehicles from continuing on Southern Cross Way, and instead was routing them to side streets. I am in the process of correcting this on OSM.

UPDATE 2018-04-16
 There were two visible errors. The first was around Doomben racecourse and was (apparently) fixed because some motorway junctions had been incorrectly labelled as “unknown”. [[OpenStreetMap:editing|Editing]] these junctions repaired the network connectivity and the road was matched correctly.
