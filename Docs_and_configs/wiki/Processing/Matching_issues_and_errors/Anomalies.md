When tracking down ways to eliminate errantly matched roads I found a curious issue on the Mitchell highway. Segments on the Mitchell Highway (and nearby roads) have much higher ratios of imputed to recorded observations than analogous roads elsewhere. This is true both in the original data set and data processed in February 2018. The reasons for this are unclear. It does not seem to be a single firm with higher inter ping periods; nor are the segments for these roads noticeably shorter (and thus less likely to be pinged); nor is there any reason to expect the area is a “GPS black spot”. There are no obvious implications of this but I wish to keep an eye on it.
