====== MatcherKState.java ======
Created Tuesday 01 May 2018

This class at src/main/java/com/bmwcarit/barefoot/matcher/MatcherKState.java has been altered to return the segments that have been traversed based on the following.

https://github.com/bmwcarit/barefoot/issues/18


I have also altered it to change the structure of the JSON file it has returned to speed up [[Processing:postbarefoot|postbarefoot.]] I haven't succeeeded in entirely flattening the JSON object but this shouldn't be too hard in future, though the gains are likely slight.
It also returns much of the imputed information. 
Note this is also where barefoot transforms timestamps from miliseconds into seconds, after requiring input in milliseconds.

I have changed it to return the osm_id instead of the gid by creating referencing funtions in the classes it inherits in roadmap/Road.java and road/Baseroad.java
I have also added the class SpatialOperator from Geography which allows me to return imputed azimuths along with other data on [[Processing:Barefoot:directionality|directionality]].

I have also changed it to exclude transitions of length 0. This means there will be NO imputed speeds of zero. This may be a fateful decision and I have buried it here rather than relying on queries to exclude them.

In addition where I unpack the roads list for matched routes, I start the loop at index 1. This deliberately excludes the first segment which is the matched segment for the previous observation, thus avoiding duplicates
