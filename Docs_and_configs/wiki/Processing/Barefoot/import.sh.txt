====== import.sh ======
Created Tuesday 01 May 2018

import.sh is a bash script to build the psql database. It has been altered to change arguments referring to the right map file and config. It has a new argument referring to [[Barefoot:probbo-roads.json|probbo-roads.json]]
It also has been altered to refer directly to the location of the osmosis executable since it was not excuting properly as part of [[process.sh.]]
The osmosis commands have also been altered to accept ways with route=ferry, whereas previously only ways with a highway tag were accepted
