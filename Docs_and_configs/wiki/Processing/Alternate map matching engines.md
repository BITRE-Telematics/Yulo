There are alternatives to Barefoot for mapmatching in the variety of routing engines. These include [[Processing/postbarefoot/OSRM]] , [Graphhopper](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper) and [[Valhalla]]. Of these Graphhopper was deemed inappropriate because of it's reliance on the GPX format. OSRM and Valhalla produced less satisfactory results with the data BITRE was receiving. It is quite possible that higher resolution data would provide better results.
